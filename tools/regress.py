"""Run the pre-cut gate over every design we have built or tried.

Designs diverge more than they look: the first trumpet never called the lap
code, so a crash in it went unseen until a spiral needed one, and a volume
check that passed the trumpet at +0.35% was 6% out on a spiral of identical
construction. A change is only known good against the whole set.

    python3 regress.py            # every design
    python3 regress.py trumpet    # those whose name matches

Two lattices, one gate. UNIFORM designs sit on a cubic block; STRETCHED ones
run their straights longer than their turns. They were gated by two forked
copies of this toolchain until 2026-09-05, which meant a change to bore_split
was only ever proved against whichever half you happened to be standing in.
The fork is gone; this runs both.

Every design carries the switches it is cut with. Passing the wrong ones gates
a design nobody is cutting -- --files never looks at the pitch, so it will not
notice.

# THREE ENTRIES WENT ON 2026-09-15, with the designs they covered: 'first
# trumpet' and 'spiral trumpet', which were the stranding meander and
# spiral, and 'wide telescope', which was the last contact design. The library
# is bend-only and non-contact now and they had nothing left to point at. 27
# designs became 24.
#
# The self-touching walks below STAY -- 'touching coil', 'tightest coil',
# 'hilbert cube 1'. They are generator tests with no folder and no page, not
# library designs: the splitter still has to handle a walk that meets itself,
# and hilbert cube 1 fills a 2x2x2 so it touches everywhere it can. Deleting
# them would drop coverage without removing a design.
#
# FIVE DESIGNS CAME BACK ON 2026-10-06, in trumpet-elbows-allowed only, where
# elbows and self-contact are allowed again. They sit in the flat
# walk/<family>/<design> tree rather than the old elbows/ and contact/ levels.
# 'first trumpet' has cut files and regenerated them byte-identical to the
# sheets deleted on 2026-09-15; the other four were only ever pages. Every walk
# here is the one its page draws -- 'spiral trumpet' used to be gated here as
# 'U3 N2 ... E12 U3', which is not the walk on its page.
