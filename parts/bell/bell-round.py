Also `--gamma` (the profile exponent), `--lap` (the seat, per side) and
`--overhang` (how far ring 0 stands proud of the bore's face). Every one of
these was accepted and named nowhere in this docstring; the error message you
get for a wrong one has always listed them, which is not documentation.

The four bells bell.py makes are square end to end: a square bore opening into a square
rim. This one keeps the square only where it has to. Station one is the same 16mm square
that closes onto the bore, and the corners are rounded away up the horn until the rim is
a true circle. Same Bessel profile, gamma 0.7, same 3mm ply, same 1.5mm lap.

THE RINGS STACK; THEY DO NOT TELESCOPE. Each ring's outer contour is the NEXT ring's
aperture offset outward by LAP, and that is what fixes the seat. Offsetting a rounded
square outward by d gives another rounded square -- half-width h+d, corner radius c+d --
and the gap between the two is exactly d in every direction, corners included. So every
joint seats on 1.5mm per side however square or however round the two rings are. A ring's
own wall then works out to its radius gain plus the lap, exactly as in bell.py.

A ROUNDED SQUARE IS THE RIGHT SHAPE and a superellipse is not. Rounded squares offset
exactly, they draw in H, V and A alone, corner radius 0 is the bore's square exactly, and
corner radius = half-width is a circle exactly. Nothing is approximated at either end of
the morph, so station one really does close onto the bore and the rim really is round.

AREA, NOT WIDTH, is held to the profile. A circle inscribed in a square has 21% less
area, so rounding the corners at constant width would quietly choke the horn at the very
place it should be opening. Each station is widened instead to enclose the area the square
bell would have had -- by nothing at the throat, by 12.8% at the round rim. `--law=width`
turns that off and follows the half-width, at the cost of the area schedule.

The profile constants are restated here rather than imported: bell.py writes its four
sheets at import time, so importing it would cut a new set of files as a side effect.

Ring sizes and the rise are stated in the file, so bell-section.py and bell-view.py read
these sheets like any other. verify_bell.py does not -- it takes an arc as proof that it
is looking at the mouthpiece -- so the checks it would have run are run here instead,
before anything is written.
