"""A bore of constant cross-section swept along a planar curve.

    python3 ribbon_bore.py                      # the 10mm 30-degree double spiral
    python3 ribbon_bore.py --no-write           # the numbers, no file

Sweep a rectangle along a curve that lies in a plane, with one axis normal to
that plane, and the duct has two FLAT faces and two CYLINDRICAL ones. The flat
pair are the cheeks and cut straight from the sheet. The curved pair are the
whole problem: 3mm birch will not bend to these radii, so they are faceted -
short flat panels, each finger-jointed into both cheeks.

The section is exactly bore x bore along every facet. At each facet joint the
walls mitre, and the area there is bore^2 / cos(phi/2):

    phi = 90 deg   +41.4%      a turn in the Minecraft lattice
    phi = 45 deg    +8.2%      an eight-facet ring
    phi = 30 deg    +3.5%      this
    phi = 15 deg    +0.9%

So the facet angle is the whole design dial, and it trades against part count
and against how short the inner panels get.

WHAT LIMITS THE BEND. The inner wall is the centreline offset inward by
bore/2, so its radius is R - bore/2 and there is no bore at all below
R = bore/2. Long before that the inner panel gets too short to carry a finger:
a Boxes.py tooth is 2 x thickness and does NOT scale with the bore, so at the
10mm bore and 30 degrees the inner panel holds no tooth at all until R = 25mm.
R 25 is therefore the floor for a 10mm bore at 30 degree facets, whatever the
shape wants to do.

# while SHEET is the MATERIAL, and the only place material thickness belongs is
# the depth of the hole it has to pass through.
#
# Setting THICK to 2.94 instead was tried first and is wrong. It moves the
# geometry: the wall offset goes 6.5 -> 6.47, the band 20 -> 19.88, and the
# tooth 6 -> 5.88, which invalidates every shape whose parameters were solved
# to land on 1000.0mm inside a 20mm band. It failed 'opposed' outright -- a
# 2.14mm panel where 9.88mm is needed -- and took the serpentine's web from
# 2.05mm to 1.106mm. The bore's walls being 0.06mm thinner than drawn opens the
# airway to 10.06mm, which is the harmless direction and not worth re-solving

# MATERIAL and belongs only in the depth of the hole it passes through. Moving
# it 2.94 -> 3.0 deepens every mortice by 0.06 and changes nothing else.
#
# IT ALSO MAKES EVERY SHEET IN THIS REPO CUT BEFORE THIS DATE STALE. Those were
# drawn for 2.94mm ply; a 3.0mm tab will not enter their slots. Redraw the

# corners; this is that edit as an option, and it lands in the same place

# hand edit did not leave one. --narrow follows the mortice instead, so it
# tracks --kerf and --sheet rather than restating a number they set.
#
# What it costs, and it is not small: the mortice loses its outboard face. A
# tab is then held across its thickness on one side only, by the cheek's inner

# along every design, the best any of them manages is 1.45mm against the 1.63mm
# that leaves 1.5mm of ply after the kerf. The room has to come from the teeth,

#
# At 20mm the lead panel carries ONE tooth, dead centre, right where the port
# is. At 30mm it carries two, at 9mm and 21mm from the tip, and the port spans

# the lead panel out and merge it into its neighbour - they are collinear, so
# the merge is exact and the airway does not change - and the nearest slot is
# 9.7mm away instead of 0.16mm.
#
# So this flag does not overrule that table, it removes its premise. The guard
# in teeth_kept() still stands: ask for a square port on a design that still
# has its lead panels and it refuses, naming the panel whose only tab the port
# would take. That refusal is the table, enforced.
#
# The SIZE is BORE, not a literal 10, so --bore carries it. The KERF is already
# a variable here: port_hole() draws the hole BURN under size, so the opening
# comes out BORE exactly at any --kerf, and the drawn square is BORE - BURN --

# BURN under size. Nothing about the hole changes; only how many there are.
#
# It is a SEPARATE flag and not the default, because two ports make a part the
# one-port sheet is not: two more holes in a cheek that is cut twice, and under
# --port-square two more panels folded away. The stem says "both" for the same
# reason it says "ported" and "square" -- the sheets are otherwise told apart

#
# The reason is what a port through both cheeks leaves you: a socket right
# through, and the side you are not using is an open hole to plug. Two ports
# make four such holes and two of them are waste. One port a cheek makes two
# holes, both of them wanted, and nothing to plug.
#
# The consequence is worth saying out loud, because it is the instrument: the
# mouthpiece goes into one FACE and the bell leaves the other. The openings no
# longer sit in the plane of the coil at all, so the total-turning-zero argument
# that puts the two RIM ends on opposite headings stops describing how the thing
# is played -- those ends are the capped ones now.
#
# It needs --port-both, having nothing to split otherwise.
PORT_PER_CHEEK = False
# --port-at=i,j: put the ports on NAMED FACETS instead of at the two ends of
# the run. Facet i is the centreline segment from vertex i to vertex i+1, and
# the hole goes PORT_FROM_TIP along it from vertex i, in the run's direction --
# so --port-at=0 is the mouth port exactly, byte for byte, and every other
# index is a place the end-based placement cannot reach.
#
# It exists because a CLOSED RING has no ends. cline[0] and cline[-1] are one
# vertex on a torus, so --port-both put both ports 19.4mm apart either side of
# the seam and no flag moved them. The two openings of a ring are wherever you
# say they are, and nothing else in this file needed to learn that: the
# per-cheek split, teeth_kept(), the label dodge, three checks and the
# narrow-rim web all read port_holes() and never ask where a port came from.
#
# The LIST LENGTH is the port count, so it replaces --port-both rather than
# joining it, and the two together are refused: each is an answer to "how many
# ports and where", and two answers is one too many.
#
# TWO PORTS ON A RING LEAVE THE AIR TWO PATHS, AND THAT IS THE POINT HERE.
# The ring is not a duct and is not meant to be one: it is a resonator with two
# parallel branches, and the SEPARATION of the ports is its tuning dial. Ports
# on facets 0 and K split an n-ring into K facets one way and n-K the other, so
# the dial is K and it runs 1 to n//2 -- most lopsided at K=1, nearest balanced
# at K=n//2. On a 13 ring at R40 that is 1:12 (19.1 against 229.7mm) down to
# 6:7 (114.9 against 134.0).
#
# PICK AN ODD n AND THE PATHS CANNOT COME OUT EQUAL. An even ring has K=n/2
# exactly antipodal, the two paths identical, the branches in phase and the
# whole effect gone. 13 has no such K: its closest split still differs by a
# facet. That is a reason to choose an odd facet count, not an accident of it.
#
# No check here has an opinion about any of this -- they are all geometric, and
# every K from 1 to n//2 passes all twelve at every radius in the ring's band.
# The dial is yours; the checks only say it can be cut.
#
# If a SINGLE path is ever wanted instead, the ring has to be blocked between
# the ports, and the only block position leaving no dead side-branch is one
# adjacent to both of them -- which forces the ports adjacent to each other and
# is the end-based placement again. Written down because it is the question a
# reader asks here, not because anything in this file wants it.
PORT_AT = None
# --port-square implies this: the square port needs the lead panel's tooth out
# of the way, and folding the lead into the facet it already lies on is the
# only move that buys the room without moving the coil. Separately settable so

#
# --port-both needs the SAME thing at the far end, so MERGE_LEAD folds the tail
# lead as well when both ends are ported. A merge that did only the mouth would

# 17 facets is not a free choice. A chord's direction is the tangent at its

#
# WHAT CLOSES IT IS THE SYMMETRY, not a solver. One lobe is a convex arc then a
# concave one, and if that unit turns exactly 360/LOBES the figure is invariant
# under a 360/LOBES rotation -- so LOBES of them come back to the start by
# construction, whatever the radii. Hence the one law here:
#
#     convex turn - concave turn = 360 / LOBES
#
# SCALLOP_IN_DEG is the concave turn and the convex one is derived, so the
# relation cannot be written down wrong. FACET has to divide all three of the
# concave turn, the derived convex turn and 360/LOBES; at LOBES 5 that makes
# 360/5 = 72 three facets of 24, and the shipped design is a 48 degree scoop
# against a 120 degree bulge. The measured closure is 4e-13mm.
#
# Both radii are bends and both answer to the same floor as every other shape:
# the tooth, not the geometry. At FACET 24 and a 10mm bore that is R30.6, and
# SCALLOP_IN_R is the one that will hit it first because the scoop is tighter
# than the bulge.
#
# THE SCOOP NEEDS TWO FACETS OR IT IS NOT THERE. Arcs are inscribed, so a chord
# turns half a facet at each end; a one-facet scoop between two bulges turns +half
# where the bulge turned -half, twice, and the centreline goes STRAIGHT through
# it. The first 800mm scallop (36 degree facets, a 36 degree scoop of R40) was
# drawn, gated and quoted as R40 with no inward bend anywhere: a decagon with
# rounded corners. The one that replaced it (2026-09-16) keeps 36 degree facets
# -- finer ones make panels too short for a square port to leave a tooth on --
# and scoops 72 degrees, two facets, R41 against a 144 degree bulge of R44.22.
# R41 is as tight as the pair goes with ports: from R42 no facet takes one.

# --shape=racetrack: a closed serpentine that is NOT radially symmetric, which
# is the whole reason it exists. A scallop repeats one lobe LOBES times about a
# centre, so its envelope is circular and the bed's 288mm of HEIGHT bounds it in
# both axes -- the 580mm of width goes unused, and the shipped 800mm scallop is
# already within a millimetre of the limit. 1600mm needs twice the envelope and
# there is no scallop that has it: deepening the lobes shrinks the figure, but
# the cheek starts crossing itself before it gets under 288. Measured across
# 5/8/10/12 lobes and facets 24 to 72; there is no window.
#
# So this one is 2-FOLD symmetric and long. Half the loop is a 180 degree cap
# then LOBES alternating half-circles joined by straights; the alternation nets
# zero turning, so the half turns 180 and two halves turn 360. Same argument as
# the scallop, one order lower: the figure is invariant under a half turn, so
# the second half closes it whatever the radii. Measured closure 5e-13mm.

# --shape=oval: a closed ellipse with its two long ends flattened, and no ports.
#
# Built like the racetrack, as half a loop taken twice, so it closes by the same
# 2-fold symmetry whatever the numbers. The half is a straight across one long
# end -- the flat -- then an arc of OVAL_END_R turning OVAL_END_DEG, an arc of
# OVAL_SIDE_R turning 180 - 2 * OVAL_END_DEG along the long side, and the end arc
# again. Four arcs a loop of two radii is the draughtsman's ellipse; the flat is
# what makes the ends blunter than an ellipse's. FACET has to divide both turns.
#
# Both radii answer to the tooth floor like every other bend, and the end arc is
# the tighter of the two, so it is the one that meets it.
#
# OVAL_SIDE_FLAT puts a straight in the middle of each long side, splitting the
# side arc in two, so the two long sides carry segments parallel to each other
# and to the long axis. FACET then has to divide HALF the side turn.
#
# THE DEFAULTS ARE THE SMALLEST ONE, found by search on 2026-09-16 against every
# check here and the rules of shape: a flat at each long end, a straight in the
# middle of each long side, at least two facets on each end arc, and the long
# axis at least 1.4 times the short. At 30 degree facets that is ends of R28
# turning 60, sides of R72 turning 30 either side of a 12.5mm straight, and
# 12.2mm flats: 314.4mm of centreline, a 148 x 116mm cheek. What stops it
# shrinking is the tooth: a 12.1mm flat, a 12mm side straight or R27.5 at the
# ends leaves an inner panel too short to hold one. 22.5 degree facets, the
# only other angle that divides both turns with two facets an end, come out
# 354mm. Without the side straights the smallest was 338.7mm.

# degrees, so the whole path is point-symmetric about the centre and the gap
# between neighbouring passes is DS_PITCH/2 by construction rather than by
# search. Pick the pitch and you have picked the gap; the cheek band needs 20.
#
# Its vertices sit on a smooth Archimedean spiral r = R0 + b*theta sampled every
# FACET degrees, NOT on the stepping-radius arcs 'spiral' uses. The note above
# says that is the one construction offset() cannot follow. That note is about
# offsetting the smooth curve and faceting the result separately; offsetting the
# faceted centreline is exact whatever placed its vertices, and the airway check
# measures 4.1e-14mm of error here against the 10mm bore. The stepping-radius
# construction cannot be used for this shape anyway: its polar radius advances
# unevenly - 7mm across one half turn and 32mm across another on the shipped
# spiral - and two arms interleaved at those radii collide.
#
# The crossover is one arc of DS_CROSS_R swinging off the arm's inner end onto a
# heading that points at the centre, then a straight through it. Both are solved,
# not chosen. A tangent from the centre to that arc only exists when the arm's
# inner end is outside twice the arc radius, so DS_R0 > 2 * DS_CROSS_R is a hard
# floor and the reason the middle is open rather than tight.
# These are the shipped design, so a bare --shape=dspiral rebuilds the sheets
# beside this file rather than something near them. R28 was the default while
# the design was cut at R30, and a bare run refused on a 9.77mm inner panel.

# 'volute' is the same idea drawn the way volute.py argued it should be: not a
# smooth spiral sampled at facets, but a chain of semicircles whose radius holds
# across each arc and steps only at the joins, where a mitre already expects a
# corner. offset() mitres a vertex assuming the curvature either side is
# constant, which is true of an arc and false of a spiral, and building the
# volute smooth once cost 6.44mm of a 10mm airway.
#
# volute.py recorded two things it could not do, and both were the single arm,
# not the construction. A volute winds inward and STOPS, so the inner end is
# enclosed -- it came within 7.75mm of the rest of the bore where it needs 20 --
# and six semicircles at 45 degrees turn 1035 degrees, leaving the openings 135
# apart when opposed needs (F-1) a whole number of turns, i.e. F = 8k+1 at 45.
#
# Interleaving a return arm answers both, which is what that file said the work
# was. Two centres, so the arm is a classical two-centre volute and its eye is
# the midpoint of them, at (-VOL_STEP/4, 0); put the eye on the origin and arm B
# is arm A turned through 180 degrees, exactly as in 'dspiral'. Then there is no
# inner end to enclose, and the openings come out 180.00 degrees apart from the
# symmetry alone -- the 8k+1 rule never binds, because the two ends are one end
# and its own half-turn.
#
# The price is spacing, and it is why this is not a metre. One arm's passes are
# VOL_STEP apart; interleaving puts a pass every VOL_STEP/2, so the step has to
# carry twice the band, and a bigger step needs a bigger R0 to keep the arcs
# off the floor. Clearance alone stops at 1078mm. The tooth stops it sooner:
# the crossover's last chord is a part facet, so its panel is shorter than the
# floor radius predicts, and R20 there gives a 9.69mm inner panel against the
# 10mm a 6mm tooth needs. R22 is the first that clears. The shipped numbers are
# what came back from sweeping the generator itself rather than the geometry:
# 1179.9mm, 21.28mm of clearance, and the openings 180.00 degrees apart.
