`mouthpiece.py` puts a 10mm ROUND aperture in its 16mm square plate, so the joint that
meets the bore throws away the bore's corners: a 10mm square channel opens into a 10mm
circle and 21% of the area steps out of the airway at station one. This one starts as the
bore actually is -- a sharp 10mm square inside a sharp 16mm plate -- and rounds the corners
away going up, exactly as bell-round.py does going out. Same rounded squares, same exact
offsets, opposite direction.

THE 4mm TAPER HAD TO GO. A ring's outer is its aperture offset by WALL, so the seat the
next ring lands on is WALL minus how much the two apertures differ in that direction. On
the flats that is half the aperture step: the old 4mm steps left 3 - 2 = 1.00mm. Through
the corners of a SHARP square the same step costs step x root2 = 2.83mm, leaving 0.17mm --
and rounding a corner pulls the diagonal in further, which takes it negative. So a square
mouthpiece cannot be built on a 4mm taper at all. At 2.5mm the corner seat is 1.23mm with
room to round. Those two figures are the STEP's, not the bore's, so they hold whatever
`--bore` says. The run is the same cone either way, sampled finer -- at the 10mm bore one
more ring and 3mm more mouthpiece, and no change to the profile the air sees.

ROUNDNESS IS NOT SCHEDULED, IT IS AS FAST AS THE SEAT ALLOWS. Each station takes the
largest corner radius that still leaves MINSEAT in both directions, in closed form. The
part therefore rounds as quickly as its own geometry permits and no quicker -- on the
default profile it reaches a true circle at station 3 (ø9.026), 6mm up from the bore, and
the throat and the whole cup are round. A run prints that station rather than assuming it.

THE TWO LAYOUTS differ in where the length goes, and at the 10mm bore in how much of it
there is -- the backbore is what scales with the bore.

    --layout=trumpet   75mm backbore, 12mm cup            30 rings, 90mm   (default)
    --layout=legacy    9mm backbore, 51mm entrance,
                       12mm cup                           24 rings, 72mm

A real mouthpiece spends its length on the backbore and keeps the cup short: the throat
opens into the cup almost at once, and the long gradual run is on the other side of it.
`legacy` has that close to inverted -- a short steep backbore and 51mm of near-cylindrical
entrance on the LIP side of the throat, which is a 51mm-deep cup by any honest reading. It
exists because a mouthpiece was built to that profile before the trumpet layout did, and
its sheet is kept as a record of that part. It was the default until 2026-09-03 and called
`asbuilt`, which said when it was made rather than whether to cut it. Do not cut it new.

`--backbore` sets the backbore rings and `--power` how it opens: 1 is a straight cone,
higher keeps it near-cylindrical off the throat and opens it later, as a real one does.

THE WALL IS NOT A CONSTANT, and it cannot be. A ring's outer is its aperture plus two
walls, so the seat above it is the wall of whichever ring is narrow there, less half the
aperture step. A real cup turns far too fast for 3mm: straight off the throat it goes ø3.66
to ø11.25 in one ring, which wants 4.80mm of wall to have anything to sit on. So each ring
takes the wall its own step demands -- 3mm nearly everywhere, 4.80mm on the throat ring of
a trumpet cup, and nowhere else. Holding the wall at 3mm would have forced a 36mm cup, which
is not a cup.

THE CUP IS A BOWL, NOT A CONE. This used to stop at ø10.06 opening 0.40mm a ring -- a 3.8
degree half-angle, a tube, against the 16 to 17mm a trumpet rim is across inside. The bowl
is an ellipse arc whose slope is zero at the rim, so the wall stands parallel to the axis
where the lip sits and turns toward the throat going down; its first ring opens 3.21mm and
its rim ring 0.33mm. A cone would meet the rim at an angle and feel like a funnel.

The three runs are named for the anatomy, which `mouthpiece.py` gets backwards:

    BACKBORE   the bore down to 5mm, the end that closes onto it, square becoming round
    ENTRANCE   the 3.66mm throat, then 0.40mm a ring out to 10.06 -- 51mm of it, which is
               long for a mouthpiece and is where to look first if it plays stuffy
    BOWL       10.06 -> 16.5mm over 12mm, the cup proper, ending at the rim

A sheet from here is the same part as a `--layout=legacy` sheet plus mouthpiece-cup.py's
four rings, ring for ring, so both routes number identically. `mouthpiece-cup.py` stays for
retrofitting a mouthpiece already glued without a bowl.

The bowl is a staircase of 3mm ply. Sand or fill the steps and round the rim over before
playing it; as cut the rim edge is a square corner and your lip will say so.
